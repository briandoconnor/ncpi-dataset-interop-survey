### Description:

"The International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) was established to ensure the ongoing usability of data generated by the 1000 Genomes Project and to extend the data set. More information is available about the IGSR."

"The 1000 Genomes Project ran between 2008 and 2015, creating the largest public catalogue of human variation and genotype data. As the project ended, the Data Coordination Centre at EMBL-EBI has received continued funding from the Wellcome Trust to maintain and expand the resource. The International Genome Sample Resource (IGSR) was set up to do this with the following aims:

Ensure the future access to and usability of the 1000 Genomes reference data
Incorporate additional published genomic data on the 1000 Genomes samples
Expand the data collection to include new populations not represented in the 1000 Genomes Project"

### Tech Details

No public API but here's the API that powers their website:

Ultimately, all roads lead back to an FTP site that houses their data.  There
isn't the concept of a GUID per file as far as I can tell.  So really it's the
path in the FTP site that gives semantic meaning to the file and it's ID.
So there isn't an easy way to take a GUID and resolve it to a given file.
